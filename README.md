# EC 425/525, Spring 2019

Welcome to **Economics 425/525: Econometrics III** (Spring 2019) at the University of Oregon (taught by Dr. [Ed Rubin](https://edrub.in) in UO Econ.).

## Lecture slides

The slides below (linked by their topic) are .html files that will only work properly if you are connected to the internet. If you're going off grid, grab the PDFs (you'll miss out on gifs and interactive plots, but the equations will render correctly). I create the slides with [`xaringan`](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/wiki) in [R](cran.r-project.org).

Thanks to [Grant McDermott](grantmcdermott.com/) for encouraging me to use `xaringan`.

Lecture 01: **Research + R + You = ðŸ’–**
