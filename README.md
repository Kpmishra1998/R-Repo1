# EC 425/525, Spring 2019

Welcome to **Economics 425/525: Econometrics III** (Spring 2019) at the University of Oregon (taught by Dr. [Ed Rubin](https://edrub.in)).

## Books

We will use two books.

**[Mostly Harmless Econometrics: An Empiricist's Companion](http://www.mostlyharmlesseconometrics.com/)** *(MHE)*
<br>Your new best friend. Read it.

**[Econometric Analysis](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Greene-Econometric-Analysis-8th-Edition/PGM334862.html)** *(Greene)*
<br>Encyclopedic resource for all (most?) of the questions MHE does not answer.

## Lecture slides

*Note:* The linked slides (below) are `.html` files that will only work properly if you are connected to the internet. If you're going off grid (camping + metrics?), grab the PDFs. You'll miss out on gifs and interactive plots, but the equations will actually show up.

**[Lecture 01: Research + R + You = ðŸ’–](https://raw.githack.com/edrubin/EC525S19/master/NotesLecture/01ResearchR/01ResearchR.html)**

1. An introduction to empirical research via applied econometrics.
1. Light introduction to R: objects, functions, and help.

**Note formats:** [.html](https://raw.githack.com/edrubin/EC525S19/master/NotesLecture/01ResearchR/01ResearchR.html) | [.pdf](https://raw.githack.com/edrubin/EC525S19/master/NotesLecture/01ResearchR/01ResearchR.pdf) | [.Rmd](https://raw.githack.com/edrubin/EC525S19/master/NotesLecture/01ResearchR/01ResearchR.Rmd)
<br>**Readings:** MHE preface + MHE chapter 1

*Another note on the notes:* I create the slides with [`xaringan`](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/wiki) in [R](cran.r-project.org). Thanks to [Grant McDermott](grantmcdermott.com/) for encouraging me to make this switch.
