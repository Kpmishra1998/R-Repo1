Welcome to **Economics 425/525: Econometrics III** (Spring 2019) at the University of Oregon (taught by Dr. [Ed Rubin](https://edrub.in)).

## Schedule

**Lecture** Monday and Wednesday 2:00pmâ€“3:20pm, [McKenzie Hall 240A](https://map.uoregon.edu/c721c7d95)

**Lab** Friday 12:00pmâ€“12:50pm, [Gerlinger Hall 302](https://map.uoregon.edu/0b99fa5c1)

## Books

We will use two books.

**[Mostly Harmless Econometrics: An Empiricist's Companion](http://www.mostlyharmlesseconometrics.com/)** *(MHE)*
<br>Your new best friend. Read it.

**[Econometric Analysis](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Greene-Econometric-Analysis-8th-Edition/PGM334862.html)** *(Greene)*
<br>Encyclopedic resource for all (most?) of the questions MHE does not answer.

## Lecture slides

*Note:* The linked slides (below) are `.html` files that will only work properly if you are connected to the internet. If you're going off grid (camping + metrics?), grab the PDFs. You'll miss out on gifs and interactive plots, but the equations will actually show up. I've removed the within-slide (incremental) pauses in the *(no pause)* slides.

**[Lecture 01: Research + R + You = ðŸ’–](https://raw.githack.com/edrubin/EC525S19/master/NotesLecture/01ResearchR/01ResearchR.html)**

*Another note on the notes:* I create the slides with [`xaringan`](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/wiki) in [R](cran.r-project.org). Thanks to [Grant McDermott](grantmcdermott.com/) for encouraging me to make this switch.

## Problem sets

## Project

Building a research project/proposal.
