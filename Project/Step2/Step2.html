# Project Proposal
## Step 2
### <strong>EC 425/525:</strong> Econometrics
### <br>Due <em>before</em> midnight (11:59pm) on .bold[Thursday, 30 May 2019]

---

class: clear



.mono.b[DUE] Your .b[typed] proposal is due *before* 11:59pm on Thursday, 30 May 2019 on [Canvas](https://canvas.uoregon.edu/).

Your grade will depend upon your ability to clearly respond to the assignment—concepts *and* constraints.

.mono.b[Assignment] Submit a project proposal that

1\. Motivates and outlines your .hi[*causal* question] of interest.
&lt;br&gt;
2\. Explains .hi[potential sources of selection] that could lead to bias.
&lt;br&gt;
3\. Describes the .hi[ideal experiment] which one could use to answer this question
&lt;br&gt;
4\. Discusses a .hi[practical research design] through which one could answer the original question—clarifying *how* this research design avoids selection bias.

.hi[Note] Your question must be caual in nature. If it is not, come up with a new question.

.mono.b[Sections] Your proposal requires the following sections/components. Separate them.

.mono.b[Title] (1 ≤ words ≤ 15)
&lt;br&gt;A title that clearly describes your question—and potentially how you would answer it.

.mono.b[Abstract] (50 ≤ words ≤ 150)
&lt;br&gt;A brief description of your project. Clearly describe the main question, how you will answer it, and why/for whom the results matter. Be concise and clear. You hook the reader here and elaborate later.

.mono.b[Question and motivation] (100 ≤ words ≤ 300)
&lt;br&gt; Explain why this area of research is interesting/important in general (not just to you). Why should your reader care/keep reading? After you .b[briefly] motivate the general topic, clearly describe your specific .b[causal question]. If necessary, motivate the specific question too.

.mono.b[Selection] (100 ≤ words ≤ 300)
&lt;br&gt; Why is this question challenging to answer empirically? In other words, what sources of selection bias concern you? If we simply run a regression of `\(y\)` on `\(X\)`, why might `\(\hat{\beta}\)` be biased?

.mono.b[Ideal experiment] (100 ≤ words ≤ 300)
&lt;br&gt; Describe the ideal experiment that would answer your question. This *ideal* experiment does not need to be practical—*i.e.*, you do not need to be able to run it in real life.

.mono.b[Practical research design] (100 ≤ words ≤ 400)
&lt;br&gt; How might you causally answer the your question in *real life*? Which data would you need? What sort of research design would you apply—selection on observables (regression with many controls, matching, propensity-score methods, *etc.*) or selection on observables (IV, RD, *etc.*)? How does this proposed research design avoid selection bias?

.mono.b[Update] Now that you've worked through these components, rewrite your abstract and title.
