## Selection on observables and/or unobservables

We've been focusing on .hi-slate[*selection-on-observables* designs], _i.e._,
$$
`\begin{align}
  \left(\text{Y}_{0i},\, \text{Y}_{1i}\right) \ci \text{D}_{i}|\text{X}_{i}
\end{align}`
$$
for .hi-slate[observable] variables `\(\text{X}_{i}\)`.


.hi-pink[*Selection-on-unobservable* designs] replace this assumption with two new (but related) assumptions

1. `\(\left(\text{Y}_{0i},\, \text{Y}_{1i}\right) \perp \text{Z}_{i}\)`

2. `\(\mathop{\text{Cov}} \left( \text{Z}_{i},\, \text{D}_{i} \right) \neq 0\)`

---
## Selection on observables and/or unobservables

Our main goal in causal-inference minded (applied) econometrics boils down to isolating .b["good" variation] in `\(\text{D}_{i}\)` (exogenous/as-good-as-random) from .b["bad" variation] (the part of `\(\text{D}_{i}\)` correlated with `\(\text{Y}_{0i}\)` and `\(\text{Y}_{1i}\)`).


(We want to avoid selection bias.)


- .hi-slate[Selection-on-observables designs] assume that we can control for all *bad variation* (selection) in `\(\text{D}_{i}\)` through a known (observed) `\(\text{X}_{i}\)`.


- .hi-pink[Selection-on-unobservables designs] assume that we can extract part of the *good variation* in `\(\text{D}_{i}\)` (generally using some `\(\text{Z}_{i}\)`) and then use this *good* part of `\(\text{D}_{i}\)` to estimate the effect of `\(\text{D}_{i}\)` on `\(\text{Y}_{i}\)`.
 We throw away the *bad variation* in `\(\text{D}_{i}\)` (it's bad).
---
## Which route?

So set of research designs is more palatable?


1. There are plenty of bad applications of both sets.&lt;br&gt;.purple[Violated assumptions, bad controls, *etc.*]


1. .hi-slate[Selection on observables] assumes we know .it[everything] about selection into treatment—we can identify .it[all] of the good (or bad) variation in `\(\text{D}_{i}\)`.
&lt;br&gt;.purple[Tough in non-experimental settings. Difficult to validate in practice.]


1. .hi-pink[Selection on unobservables] assumes we can isolate .it[some] good/clean variation in `\(\text{D}_{i}\)`, which we then use to estimate the effect of `\(\text{D}_{i}\)` on `\(\text{Y}_{i}\)`.
&lt;br&gt;.purple[Seems more plausible. Possible to validate. May be underpowered.]

## Introduction

.attn[Instrumental variables] (IV).super[.pink[†]] is the canonical selection-on-unobservables design—isolating *good variation* in `\(\text{D}_{i}\)` via some magical .pink[instrument] `\(\color{#e64173}{\text{Z}_{i}}\)`.

.footnote[.pink[†] For the moment, we're lumping together IV and two-stage least squares (2SLS) together—as many people do—even though they are technically different.]


Consider some model (structural equation)
$$
`\begin{align}
  \text{Y}_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{D}_{i} + \varepsilon_i \tag{1}
\end{align}`
$$
To guarantee consistent OLS estimates for `\(\beta_1\)`, want `\(\mathop{\text{Cov}} \left( \text{D}_{i},\,\varepsilon_i \right)=0\)`.
&lt;br&gt; In general, this is a heroic assumption.


.note[Alternative:] Estimate `\(\beta_1\)` via instrumental variables.

## Definition

For our model
$$
`\begin{align}
  \text{Y}_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{D}_{i} + \varepsilon_i \tag{1}
\end{align}`
$$

A valid .attn[instrument] is a variable `\(\color{#e64173}{\text{Z}_{i}}\)` such that

1. `\(\mathop{\text{Cov}} \left( \color{#e64173}{\text{Z}_{i}},\, \text{D}_{i} \right) \neq 0\)`
&lt;br&gt;our .pink[instrument] correlates with treatment
 (so we can keep part of `\(\text{D}_{i}\)`)


2. `\(\mathop{\text{Cov}} \left( \color{#e64173}{\text{Z}_{i}},\, \varepsilon_i \right) = 0\)`
&lt;br&gt;our .pink[instrument] is uncorrelated with other (non- `\(\!\!\text{D}_{i}\)`) determinants of `\(\text{Y}_{i}\)`
, _i.e._, `\(\color{#e64173}{\text{Z}_{i}}\)` is excludable from equation `\((1)\)`.

## Example

Back to the returns to a college degree,
$$
`\begin{align}
  \text{Income}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Grad}_i + \varepsilon_i
\end{align}`
$$
OLS is likely biased.


What if that state conducts a (random) .hi-pink[lottery] for scholarships?


Let `\(\color{#e64173}{\text{Lottery}_i}\)` denote an indicator for whether `\(i\)` won a lottery scholarship..super[.pink[†]]

.footnote[.pink[†] We'll have to focus on families who were eligible/who applied.]


1. `\(\mathop{\text{Cov}} \left( \color{#e64173}{\text{Lottery}_i},\, \text{Grad}_i \right)\neq 0\)` `\(\left( &gt;0 \right)\)` if scholarships increase grad. rates.


2. `\(\mathop{\text{Cov}} \left(\color{#e64173}{\text{Lottery}_i},\, \varepsilon_i\right) = 0\)` since the lottery is randomized.

## The IV estimator

The IV estimator for our model
$$
`\begin{align}
  \text{Y}_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{D}_{i} + \varepsilon_i \tag{1}
\end{align}`
$$
with (valid) instrument `\(\color{#e64173}{\text{Z}_{i}}\)` is
$$
`\begin{align}
   \hat{\beta}_\text{IV} = \left(\text{Z}'\text{D}\right)^{-1} \left( \text{Z}'\text{Y}\right)
\end{align}`
$$

name: iv-estimator


If you have no covariates, then
$$
`\begin{align}
  \hat{\beta}_\text{IV} = \dfrac{\mathop{\text{Cov}} \left( \color{#e64173}{\text{Z}_{i}},\, \text{Y}_{i}\right)}{\mathop{\text{Cov}} \left( \color{#e64173}{\text{Z}_{i}},\, \text{D}_{i} \right)}
\end{align}`
$$
---

If you have additional (exogenous) covariates `\(\text{X}_i\)`, then
$$
`\begin{align}
  \text{Z} &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}\color{#e64173}{\text{Z}_{i}} &amp; \text{X}_{i}\end{bmatrix}

# Two-stage least squares

---
class: inverse, middle
---
name: setup
## Setup

You'll commonly see IV implemented as a two-stage process known as&lt;br&gt;.attn[two-stage least squares] (2SLS).


.attn[First stage] Estimate the effect of the instrument `\(\color{#e64173}{\text{Z}_{i}}\)` on our endogenous variable `\(\text{D}_{i}\)` and (predetermined) covariates `\(\text{X}_{i}\)`. Save `\(\color{#6A5ACD}{\widehat{\text{D}}_{i}}\)`.

$$
`\begin{align}
  \text{D}_{i} = \gamma_1 \color{#e64173}{\text{Z}_{i}} + \gamma_2 \text{X}_{i} + u_i
\end{align}`
$$


.attn[Second stage] Estimate model we wanted—but only using the variation in `\(\text{D}_{i}\)` that correlates with `\(\color{#e64173}{\text{Z}_{i}}\)`, _i.e._, `\(\color{#6A5ACD}{\widehat{\text{D}}_{i}}\)`.

$$
`\begin{align}
  \text{Y}_{i} = \beta_1 \color{#6A5ACD}{\widehat{\text{D}}_{i}} + \beta_2 \text{X}_{i} + \varepsilon_i
\end{align}`
$$

.note[Note] The controls `\(\text{X}_{i}\)` must match in the first and second stages.

---
## IV estimation

This two-step procedure, with a valid instrument, produces an estimator `\(\hat{\beta}_1\)` that is consistent for `\(\beta_1\)`.

$$
`\begin{align}
  \hat{\beta}_\text{2SLS} &amp;= \left( \text{D}' \text{P}_{\text{Z}} \text{D} \right)^{-1} \left( \text{D}' \text{P}_{\text{Z}} \text{Y} \right)
  \\[0.3em]
  \text{P}_{\text{Z}} &amp;= \text{Z} \left( \text{Z}'\text{Z} \right)^{-1} \text{Z}'
\end{align}`
$$

where `\(\text{D}\)` is a matrix of our treatment and predetermined covariates `\(\left( \text{X}_{i} \right)\)` and `\(Z\)` is a matrix of our instrument and our predetermined covariates.

---
## IV estimation

Important notes

- The controls `\(\left( \text{X}_{i} \right)\)` must match in the first and second stages.

- If you have exactly .hi-slate[one instrument] and exactly .hi-slate[one endogenous variable], then 2SLS and IV are identical.

- Your second-stage standard errors are not correct.

---
name: reduced-form
## The reduced form

In addition to the regressions within the two stages of 2SLS
1. `\(\text{D}_{i} = \gamma_1 \color{#e64173}{\text{Z}_{i}} + \gamma_2 \text{X}_{i} + u_i\)`
2. `\(\text{Y}_{i} = \beta_1 \color{#6A5ACD}{\widehat{\text{D}}_{i}} + \beta_2 \text{X}_{i} + \varepsilon_i\)`

there is a third important and related regression: the reduced form.


The .attn[reduced form] regresses the outcome `\(\text{Y}_{i}\)` (LHS of the second stage) on our instrument `\(\color{#e64173}{\text{Z}_{i}}\)` and covariates `\(\text{X}_{i}\)` (RHS of the first stage).
$$
`\begin{align}
   \text{Y}_{i} = \pi_1 \color{#e64173}{\text{Z}_{i}} + \pi_2 \text{X}_{i} + u_i
\end{align}`
$$
Thus, the reduced form provides a consistent estimate of the causal effect of our instrument on the outcome.
---
## The reduced form, continued

While the reduced form estimates the causal effect of the instrument on our outcome, we're often actually interested in the effect of *treatment* `\(\left( \text{D}_{i} \right)\)`.


That said, the reduced form is still incredibly helpful/important:

- Clarifies your source of identifying variation.

- Does not suffer from *weak instruments* problems.

- Only requires `\(\mathop{\text{Cov}} \left( \text{Z}_{i},\, \varepsilon_i \right) = 0\)`.

- Offers insights into your estimates

$$
`\begin{align}
  \widehat{\beta}_{1}^\text{2SLS} = \dfrac{\widehat{\pi}_{1}}{\widehat{\gamma}_{1}}
\end{align}`
$$
when you have exactly one instrument.

---
name: reduced-intuition
## The reduced form, intuition

This expression for the 2SLS (and IV) estimator can be very helpful.
$$
`\begin{align}
  \widehat{\beta}_{1}^\text{2SLS} = \dfrac{\color{#6A5ACD}{\widehat{\pi}_{1}}}{\color{#20B2AA}{\widehat{\gamma}_{1}}} = \dfrac{\color{#6A5ACD}{\text{Reduced-form estimate}}}{\color{#20B2AA}{\text{First-stage estimate}}}
\end{align}`
$$


What's the interpretation/intuition?


Back to our example: `\(\widehat{\beta}_1 =\)` est. effect of college graduation on income.


`\(\color{#6A5ACD}{\widehat{\pi}_1}\)` gives the estimated causal effect of the scholarship lottery on income
, but what share of lottery winners graduate? We need to rescale if `\(&lt;\)` 100%.


`\(\color{#20B2AA}{\widehat{\gamma}_1}\)` estimates the effect of winning the scholarship lottery on graduation
—the share of winners who graduated due to winning.
 We can scale with `\(\color{#20B2AA}{\widehat{\gamma}_1}\)`!
---
name: reduced-example
## The reduced form, example

To see why this scaling makes sense, imagine that 50% of lottery winners graduate from college due to the lottery, _i.e._, `\(\color{#20B2AA}{\widehat{\gamma}_1 =}\)` .turquoise[0.50]..super[.pink[†]]

.footnote[.pink[†] Imagine none of the applicants would have graduated otherwise]


Our reduced-form estimate of `\(\color{#6A5ACD}{\widehat{\pi}_1=}\)` .purple[$5,000] says that lottery winners make $5,000 more than the control group, on average.


However, half of the winners did not graduate, so `\(\color{#6A5ACD}{\widehat{\pi}_1}\)` "underestimates" the effect of college graduation by combining graduates by nongraduates.


Thus, we want to double `\(\color{#6A5ACD}{\widehat{\pi}_1}\)`, _i.e._, divide by `\(\color{#20B2AA}{\widehat{\gamma}_1}\)`:
`\(\color{#6A5ACD}{\widehat{\pi}_1}/\color{#20B2AA}{\widehat{\gamma}_1}\)` = .turquoise[$5,000]/.purple[0.5] = $10,000.

.qa[Q] How do we get this magical expression? `\(\left( \widehat{\beta}_1^\text{IV} = \dfrac{\widehat{\pi}_1}{\widehat{\gamma}_1} \right)\)`


## Derivation


`\(\widehat{\beta}_1^\text{IV} = \left( \text{Z}'\text{D} \right)^{-1} \left( \text{Z}'\text{Y} \right)\)`


`\(\color{#ffffff}{\widehat{\beta}_1^\text{IV}} = \left( \widetilde{\text{Z}}'\widetilde{\text{D}} \right)^{-1} \left( \widetilde{\text{Z}}'\text{Y} \right)\)`   applying FWL to reduce `\(\text{D}\)` and `\(\text{Z}\)` to vectors.


`\(\color{#ffffff}{\widehat{\beta}_1^\text{IV}} = \dfrac{\mathop{\text{Cov}} \left( \widetilde{\text{Z}}_{i},\, \text{Y}_{i} \right)}{\mathop{\text{Cov}} \left( \widetilde{\text{Z}}_i,\, \widetilde{\text{D}}_{i} \right)}\)`
 `\(= \dfrac{\mathop{\text{Cov}} \left( \widetilde{\text{Z}}_{i},\, \text{Y}_{i} \right)/\mathop{\text{Var}} \left( \widetilde{\text{Z}}_i \right)}{\mathop{\text{Cov}} \left( \widetilde{\text{Z}}_i,\, \widetilde{\text{D}}_{i} \right)/\mathop{\text{Var}} \left( \widetilde{\text{Z}}_i \right)}\)`

# IV: Mechanics and intuition

name: iv-intuition

## Setup

In this section, we'll use medical trials as a working example..super[.pink[†]]

.footnote[.pink[†] Credit/thanks go to [Michael Anderson](https://are.berkeley.edu/~mlanderson/ARE_Website/Home.html) for this example—and much of these notes.]


We are interested in the regression model for the effect of some treatment (_e.g._, blood-pressure medication) on medical outcome `\(\text{Y}_{i}\)`
$$
`\begin{align}
  \text{Y}_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{D}_{i} + \varepsilon_i
\end{align}`
$$
`\(\text{D}_{i}\)` indicates whether `\(i\)` *takes* the treatment (medication). `\(\varepsilon_i\)` captures all other factors that affect `\(\text{Y}_{i}\)`.
 Or in potential-outcomes framework:

$$
`\begin{align}
  \text{Y}_{i} &amp;= \text{Y}_{1i} \text{D}_{i} + \text{Y}_{0i} (1-\text{D}_{i}) \\
  \text{Y}_{0i} &amp;= \beta_0 + \varepsilon_i \\
  \text{Y}_{1i} &amp;= \text{Y}_{0i} + \beta_1
\end{align}`
$$

## Research design

.note[Goal] .hi-slate[Estimate the effect of blood-pressure medication] on blood pressure.


.note[Challenge] .hi-slate[Selection bias:] Even if treatment reduces blood pressure, selection bias will fights against the estimated effect.


.note[Solution] .hi-slate[Randomized medical trial:] Ask randomly chosen individuals in treatment group to take the pill. Control individual get placebo (or nothing).


.note[Analysis 1] .attn[Intention to treat] (.attn[ITT]): `\(\widehat{\beta}_1^\text{ITT} = \overline{\text{Y}}_\text{Trt} - \overline{\text{Y}}_\text{Ctrl}\)`


.note[ITT problem] .attn[Bias from noncompliance:] People don't always follow rules.
&lt;br&gt;*E.g.*, treated folks who don't take pills; control folks who take pills.


.note[Analysis 2] .hi-slate[IV!]
 Instrument medication `\(\text{D}_{i}\)` with intention to treat `\(\text{Z}_{i}\)`.
---
## The IV solution

First question: Is `\(\text{Z}_{i}\)` a valid instrument for `\(\text{D}_{i}\)`?


1. `\(\mathop{\text{Cov}} \left( \text{Z}_{i},\, \varepsilon_i \right) = 0\)` as `\(\text{Z}_{i}\)` was randomly assigned (exclusion restriction).


1. `\(\mathop{\text{Cov}} \left( \text{Z}_{i},\, \text{D}_{i} \right)\neq 0\)` if assignment to treatment changes the likelihood you take the pills (first stage).


∴ `\(\text{Z}_{i}\)` is a valid instrument for `\(\text{D}_{i}\)` and IV consistently estimates `\(\beta_1\)`.
---
name: iv-noncompliance
## Noncompliance

.attn[Noncompliant] individuals do not abide by their treatment assignment.


Let's see how IV "solves" this problems.


First, assume noncompliance only affects treated individuals—*i.e.*, treated folks sometimes don't take their pills; control folks never take pills.

---
## Noncompliance, continued

The .hi-slate[first stage] recovers the share of treatment individuals who take the pill
$$
`\begin{align}
  \text{D}_{i} = \gamma_1 \text{Z}_{i} + u_i
\end{align}`
$$
*i.e.*, if 50% of treated individuals take the medication, `\(\widehat{\gamma} =\)` 0.50.


The .hi-slate[reduced form] estimates the *ITT*
$$
`\begin{align}
  \text{Y}_{i} = \pi_1 \text{Z}_{i} + v_i
\end{align}`
$$
which we know IV rescales using the first stage
$$
`\begin{align}
  \widehat{\beta}_{1}^\text{IV} = \dfrac{\widehat{\pi}_1}{\widehat{\gamma}_1} = \dfrac{\widehat{\pi}_1}{0.50} =
  2 \times \widehat{\pi}_1
\end{align}`
$$
---
name: iv-rescale
## Noncompliance, continued

IV solves the noncompliance issue by rescaling by the rate of compliance.


If everyone perfectly complies, then `\(\widehat{\gamma}_1 = 1\)` and `\(\widehat{\beta}_{1}^\text{IV} = \widehat{\pi}_1/1 = \widehat{\beta}_{1}^\text{ITT}\)`.


.ex[Further example] `\(N_\text{Trt}\)` = 10; trt. compliance = 50%; ctrl. compliance = 100%.

`\(\overline{\text{Y}}_\text{Trt} = \dfrac{5 (\beta_0 + \beta_1) + 5 (\beta_0)}{10} = \beta_0 + \dfrac{\beta_1}{2}\)`
 and `\(\overline{\text{Y}}_\text{Ctrl} = \beta_0\)`.


So our reduced-form estimate (the ITT) is `\(\widehat{\gamma}_1 = \dfrac{\beta_1}{2}\)` (half the true effect).


IV consistently estimates `\(\beta_1\)` via rescaling the ITT by the rate of compliance
$$
`\begin{align}
  \widehat{\beta}_1^\text{IV} = \dfrac{\pi}{\gamma} = \dfrac{\beta_1/2}{1/2} = \beta_1
\end{align}`
$$

## Takeaways

Main points

1. IV .b[rescales] .pink[the causal effect of] `\(\color{#e64173}{\text{Z}_{i}}\)` .pink[on] `\(\color{#e64173}{\text{Y}_{i}}\)` by .purple[the causal effect of] `\(\color{#6A5ACD}{\text{Z}_{i}}\)` .purple[on] `\(\color{#6A5ACD}{\text{D}_{i}}\)`.


1. IV .b[does not] compare treated compliers to untreated compliers.
&lt;br&gt;Such a comparison/estimator would re-introduce selection bias.
