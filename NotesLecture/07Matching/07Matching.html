# Follow up

## OLS weighting

At the beginnign of the lecture, we discussed OLS weightsâ€”especially for heterogeneous treatment effects.

We should keep our questions clear.

1. Which weights on `\(\beta_1\)` and `\(\beta_2\)` recover `\(\beta_{12}\)`, where `\(\beta_i\)` comes from a regression using observations in group `\(i\)`?

2. What does `\(\beta\)` represent when the treatment effect is heterogeneous?

More soon.

## The gist

Remember the .hi[conditional independence assumption].super[.pink[â€ ]] in a settingâ€”_i.e._, treatment is as-good-as random conditional on a known set of covariates?

.footnote[.pink[â€ ] AKA "selection on observables"]

--

.hi[Matching estimators] take us at our word.

--

If we really believe `\(\left(\text{Y}_{1i},\, \text{Y}_{0i} \right)\ci \text{D}_{i}|\text{X}_{i}\)`, then we can just calculate a bunch of treatment effects conditional on `\(\text{X}_{i}\)`, _i.e._,
$$
`\begin{align}
  \tau(x) = \mathop{E}\left[ \text{Y}_{1i} - \text{Y}_{0i} \mid \text{X}_{i} = x \right]
\end{align}`
$$

--

.note[The idea:] Estimate a treatment effect only using observations with (nearly?) identical values of `\(\text{X}_{i}\)`.
--
 The CIA buys us causality within these groups.
---
name: goals
## Goals

Let's return to .b[the fundamental problem of causal inference] for a moment.

1. We want/need to know `\(\tau_i = \text{Y}_{1i} - \text{Y}_{0i}\)`.
2. We cannot simultaneously observe *both* `\(\text{Y}_{1i}\)` *and* `\(\text{Y}_{0i}\)`.

--

Most empirical strategies boil to strategies to estimate `\(\text{Y}_{0i}\)` for treated individualsâ€”the unobservable counterfactual for the treatment group.

--

Matching is no different.

We match untreated observations to treated observations using `\(\text{X}_{i}\)`, _i.e._, calculate a `\(\widehat{\text{Y}_{0i}}\)` for each `\(\text{Y}_{1i}\)`, based upon "matched" untreated individuals.
---
## More formally

We want to construct a counterfactual for each individual with `\(\text{D}_{i}=1\)`.

--

The counterfactual for `\(i\)` should only use individuals that match `\(\text{X}_{i}\)`.

--

Let there be `\(N_T\)` treated individuals and `\(N_C\)` control individuals. We want
- `\(N_T\)` sets of weights
- with `\(N_C\)` weights in each set
--
: `\(w_i(j)\, \left( i = 1,\,\ldots,\, N_T;\, j=1,\,\ldots,\, N_C \right)\)`

--

Assume `\(\sum_j w_i(j) = 1\)`. Our estimate for the counterfactual of treated `\(i\)` is
$$
`\begin{align}
  \widehat{\text{Y}_{0i}} = \sum_{j\in \left( D=0 \right)} w_i(j) \text{Y}_{i}
\end{align}`
$$
---
name: generic
## More formally

If our estimated counterfactual for treated individual `\(i\)` is
$$
`\begin{align}
  \widehat{\text{Y}_{0i}} = \sum_j w_i(j) \text{Y}_{i}
\end{align}`
$$
then our estimated treatment effect (for individual `\(i\)`) is
$$
`\begin{align}
  \hat{\tau}_i = \text{Y}_{1i} - \widehat{\text{Y}_{0i}} = \text{Y}_{1i} - \sum_j w_i(j) \text{Y}_{i}
\end{align}`
$$

--

âˆ´ a generic matching estimator for the treatment effect on the treated is
$$
`\begin{align}
  \hat{\tau}_M = \dfrac{1}{N_T} \sum_{i \in \left( \text{D}=1 \right)} \left( \text{Y}_{1i} - \widehat{\text{Y}_{0i}} \right) = \dfrac{1}{N_T} \sum_{i \in \left( \text{D}=1 \right)} \left( \text{Y}_{1i} - \sum_{j\in \left( D=0 \right)} w_i(j) \text{Y}_{i} \right)
\end{align}`
$$

--

.qa[Q] Where does one find these handy weights?

--

.qa[A] You've got options, but you need to choose carefully/responsibly.

*E.g.*, if `\(w_i(j) = \frac{1}{N_C}\)` for all `\((i,j)\)`, then we're back to a difference in means.
&lt;br&gt; This weighting doesn't abide by our conditional independence assumption.

--

.note[The plan] Choose weights `\(w_i(j)\)` that indicate .hi-slate[*how close*] `\(\text{X}_{j}\)` is to `\(\text{X}_{i}\)`.
---
name: discrete
## Proximity

Our weights `\(w_i(j)\)` should be a measure of .hi-slate[*how close*] `\(\text{X}_{j}\)` is to `\(\text{X}_{i}\)`.

--

If `\(\text{X}\)` is .hi-pink[discrete], then we can consider equality, _i.e._, `\(w_i(j) = \mathbb{I}(\text{X}_{i} = \text{X}_{j})\)`, scaling as necessary to get `\(\sum_j w_i(j) = 1\)`.

---
name: nn-euclidean
## Proximity

Our weights `\(w_i(j)\)` should be a measure of .hi-slate[*how close*] `\(\text{X}_{j}\)` is to `\(\text{X}_{i}\)`.

If `\(\text{X}\)` is .hi-purple[continuous], then we need .it[proximity] rather than .it[equality].

--

.purple[*Nearest-neighbor* matching] chooses the single closest control observation using the Euclidean distance between `\(\text{X}_{i}\)` and `\(\text{X}_{j}\)`, _i.e._,

$$
`\begin{align}
  \text{d}_{i,j} = \left( \text{X}_{i} - \text{X}_{j} \right)'\left(\text{X}_{i} - \text{X}_{j}\right)
\end{align}`
$$

--

- `\(\hat{\tau}_i = \text{Y}_{1i} - \text{Y}_{0j}^i\)`, where `\(\text{Y}_{0j}^i\)` is `\(i\)`'s nearest neighbor in the control group.
- .hi-slate[Estimator:] `\(\hat{\tau}_M = \frac{1}{N_T} \sum_i \hat{\tau}_i\)`
- Produces causal estimates if CIA is valid *and* we have sufficient overlap.
- Suffers from arbitrary choices of units.

---
name: nn-mahalanobis
## Proximity

Our weights `\(w_i(j)\)` should be a measure of .hi-slate[*how close*] `\(\text{X}_{j}\)` is to `\(\text{X}_{i}\)`.

If `\(\text{X}\)` is .hi-purple[continuous], then we need .it[proximity] rather than .it[equality].

.purple[*Nearest-neighbor* matching with Mahalanobis distance] chooses the single closest control using .purple[Mahalanobis] distance between `\(\text{X}_{i}\)` and `\(\text{X}_{j}\)`, _i.e._,

$$
`\begin{align}
  \text{d}_{i,j} = \left( \text{X}_{i} - \text{X}_{j} \right)' \Sigma_{X}^{-1} \left(\text{X}_{i} - \text{X}_{j}\right)
\end{align}`
$$
where `\(\Sigma_{X}^{-1}\)` is the covariance matrix of `\(\text{X}\)`.

--

- .hi-slate[Estimator:] `\(\hat{\tau}_M = \frac{1}{N_T} \sum_i \hat{\tau}_i\)` where `\(\left(\hat{\tau}_i = \text{Y}_{1i} - \text{Y}_{0j}^i\right)\)`
- Produces causal estimates if CIA is valid *and* we have sufficient overlap.
- Does not suffer from arbitrary choices of units.
---
## More neighbors?

Why limit ourselves to a .b[single] "best" match?

If we're going to let a function/algorithm choose the *nearest* match, can't we also let the function/algorithm choose *how many* matches?

Furthermore, if `\(N_C \gg N_T\)`, it we're throwing away *a lot* of information.

We could instead use this information and be more efficient.

---
name: kernel
## More neighbors!

.purple[Kernel matching] gives positive weight to all control observations within some .hi-slate[bandwidth] `\(h\)`, with higher weight for closer matches determined by some .hi-slate[kernel function] `\(K(\cdot)\)`,
$$
`\begin{align}
  w_i(j) = \dfrac{K\!\!\left( \dfrac{\text{X}_{j} - \text{X}_{i}}{h} \right)}{\sum_{j\in(D=0)} K\!\!\left(\dfrac{\text{X}_{j} - \text{X}_{i}}{h} \right)}

# Kernels
## Aside

Kernel functions are good for more than just matching.

You will most commonly see/use them smoothing out densitiesâ€”providing a smooth, moving-window average.

--

_E.g._, .mono[R]'s (`ggplot2`'s) smooth, density-plotting function `geom_density()`.

`geom_density()` defaults to `kernel = "gaussian"`, but you can specify many other kernel functions (including `"epanechnikov"`).

--

You can also change the `bandwidth` argument. The default is a bandwidth-choosing function called `bw.nrd0()`.

layout: true
# Matching

---
## Adding neighbors

As we add more neighborsâ€”either moving from `\(1\)` to `\(n&gt;1\)` or increasing our bandwidthâ€”we potentially increase the efficiency of our estimator.

--

We need to .hi[be careful not to add *too many* controls] for each treated `\(i\)`.

--

CIA requires that we're actually conditioning on the observablesâ€”it does not allow us to take a simple average across all control observations.
---
## The curse of dimensionality.super[.pink[â€ ]]

.footnote[.pink[â€ ] I'm not sure if this is a title for Harry Potter or Indiana Jones... crossover anyone?]

It turns out kernel- and bandwidth-selection are not our biggest enemies.

--

As the dimension of `\(\text{X}\)` expands (matching on more variables), it becomes .hi[harder and harder to find a nice, close control] for each treated unit.

--

We need a way to shrink the dimensionality of `\(\text{X}\)`.

name: setup
## Setup

Let's begin with two assumptionsâ€”one old and one new.

1. .hi-purple[Conditional independence:] `\(\left( \text{Y}_{0i},\, \text{Y}_{1i} \right) \ci \text{D}_{i}|\text{X}_{i}\)`

2. .hi-purple[Overlap:] `\(0 &lt; \mathop{\text{Pr}}\left(\text{D}_{i} = 1 \mid \text{X}_{i}\right) &lt; 1\)`

--

We can estimate an average treatment effect by conditioning on `\(\text{X}_{i}\)`.

--

However, overlap may fail if the dimensions of `\(X\)` are large and `\(N\)` is finite.

--

.hi[Propensity scores provide a solution] to this mess.
---
name: magic
## The magic

It turns out that if `\(\left( \text{Y}_{0i},\,\text{Y}_{1i} \right) \ci \text{D}_{i}|\text{X}_{i},\,\)` then we actually only need to match/condition on `\(p(\text{X}_{i}) = \mathop{E}\left[ \text{D}_{i} | \text{X}_{i} \right]\)`.

--

`\(p(\text{X}_{i})\)` is the .attn[propensity score]
--
, the probability of treatment given `\(\text{X}_{i}.\)`

--

.attn[Propensity-score theorem] If `\(\left( \text{Y}_{0i},\,\text{Y}_{1i} \right) \ci \text{D}_{i}|\text{X}_{i},\,\)` then `\(\left( \text{Y}_{0i},\,\text{Y}_{1i} \right) \ci \text{D}_{i}|p(\text{X}_{i}).\)`

--

This theorem extends our CIA to a one-dimensional score, avoiding the curse of dimensionality.

## Proof

To prove this theorem, we will show `\(\mathop{\text{Pr}}\left(\text{D}_{i}=1 \mid \text{Y}_{0i},\, \text{Y}_{1i},\, p(\text{X}_{i})\right) = p(\text{X}_{i})\)`, _i.e._, `\(\text{D}_{i}\)` is independent of `\(\left( \text{Y}_{0i},\, \text{Y}_{1i} \right)\)` after conditioning on `\(p(\text{X}_{i})\)`.

name: intuition
## Intuition

.qa[Q] What's going on here?

`\(\text{X}_{i}\)` carries way more information than `\(p(\text{X}_{i})\)`, so how can we still get conditional independence of treatment by only conditioning on `\(p(\text{X}_{i})\)`?

--

.qa[A].sub[.pink[1]] Conditional independence of treatment isn't about extracting all of the information possible from `\(\text{X}_{i}\)`. We actually only care about creating a situation in which `\(\text{D}_{i}|\)`something is independent of `\(\left( \text{Y}_{0i},\,\text{Y}_{1i} \right)\)`.

--

.qa[A].sub[.pink[2]] Back to our main concern: .hi[selection bias]. People select into treatment. If `\(\text{X}\)` says two people were equally likely to be treated, and if `\(\text{X}_{i}\)` explains all of selection (CIA), then cannot be selection between these two people.
---
name: estimation
## Estimation

So where do propensity scores come from?

--

We estimate themâ€”and there are a lot of ways to do that.

1. Flexible (_i.e._, interactions) logit specification
2. Kernel regression (remember kernel functions?)
3. Many othersâ€”machine learning, series-logit estimator, *etc.*

--

.qa[Q] Can we just use plain OLS (linear probability model)?

--

.qa[A] Sort of. Think about FWL. This route is going to be the same as a regression conditioning on `\(\text{X}_{i}\)`.

---
## Estimation

From *MHE* (p. 83)

.qa[Question]

&gt; A big question here is how to best model and estimate `\(p(\text{X}_{i})\)`...

.qa[Answer]

&gt; The answer to this is inherently application-specific. A growing empirical literature suggests that a logit model for the propensity score with a few polynomial terms in continuous covariates works well in practice...
---
name: application
## Application

So you have some estimated propensity scores `\(\hat{p}(\text{X}_{i})\)`. What next?

--

.note[Option 1] Conditioning via regression

--

.note[Option 1a] Use a .b[regression to condition] on `\(p(\text{X}_{i})\)`, _i.e._,
$$
`\begin{align}
   \text{Y}_{i} = \alpha + \delta \text{D}_{i} + \beta p(\text{X}_{i}) + u_i \tag{1a}
\end{align}`
$$

--

.note[Option 1b] If we think treatment effects are heterogeneous and may covary with `\(\text{X}\)`, then we might want to also .b[interact] treatment with `\(p(\text{X}_{i})\)`, _i.e._,
$$
`\begin{align}
   \text{Y}_{i} = \alpha + \delta_1 \text{D}_{i} + \delta_2 \text{D}_{i} p(\text{X}_{i}) + \beta p(\text{X}_{i}) + u_i \tag{1b}
\end{align}`
$$
---
name: heterogeneity
## Heterogeneity with regression

Let's think a bit more about heterogeneous treatment effects in this setting.
$$
`\begin{align}
  \text{Y}_{0i} &amp;= \alpha + \beta \text{X}_{i} + u_i \\
  \text{Y}_{1i} &amp;= \text{Y}_{0i} + \delta_1 + \delta_2 \text{X}_{i}
\end{align}`
$$
_i.e._, the treatment effect depends upon `\(\text{X}_{i}\)`.

--

`\(\text{Y}_{i} = \text{D}_{i}\text{Y}_{1i} + \left( 1 - \text{D}_{i} \right) \text{Y}_{0i}\)`

--
.pad-left[
`\(= \text{D}_{i}\bigg( \text{Y}_{0i} + \delta_1 + \delta_2 \text{X}_{i} \bigg) + \left( 1 - \text{D}_{i} \right) \text{Y}_{0i}\)`
]

--
.pad-left[
`\(= \text{Y}_{0i} + \delta_1 \text{D}_{i} + \delta_2 \text{D}_{i} \text{X}_{i}\)`
]

--
.pad-left[
`\(= \alpha + \delta_1 \text{D}_{i} + \delta_2 \text{D}_{i} \text{X}_{i} + \beta \text{X}_{i} + u_i\)`
]

---
## Heterogeneity

This final equation
$$
`\begin{align}
  \text{Y}_{i} = \alpha + \delta_1 \text{D}_{i} + \delta_2 \text{D}_{i} \text{X}_{i} + \beta \text{X}_{i} + u_i
\end{align}`
$$

--

suggests that we want `\(p(\text{X}_{i})\)` *and* `\(\text{D}_{i}p(\text{X}_{i})\)`, _i.e._,
$$
`\begin{align}
   \text{Y}_{i} = \alpha + \delta_1 \text{D}_{i} + \delta_2 \text{D}_{i} p(\text{X}_{i}) + \beta p(\text{X}_{i}) + u_i \tag{1b}
\end{align}`
$$

--

which yields
1. a .hi-slate[group-specific treatment effect] `\(\delta_1 + \delta_2 \text{X}_{i}\)` for each `\(\text{X}_{i}\)`

2. an .hi-slate[average treatment effect] `\(\delta_1 + \delta_2 \overline{p}(\text{X}_{i})\)`
---
## More flexibility

We motivated propensity scores with a desire to reduce dimensionality and estimate/choose/assume fewer parameters.

Adding `\(p(\text{X}_{i})\)` and `\(\text{D}_{i}p(\text{X}_{i})\)` as covariates in a linear regression doesn't quite exhaust our potential for flexible/nonparametric estimation.

---
name: blocking
## Blocking

.note[Option 2] Block (stratify) on propensity scores.

--

1. Divide the range of `\(\hat{p}(\text{X}_{i})\)` into `\(K\)` blocks (_e.g._, 0.05-wide blocks).

1. Place each observation into a block via its `\(\hat{p}(\text{X}_{i})\)`.

1. Calculate `\(\hat{\tau}_k\)` for each block via difference in means.

1. Average the `\(\hat{\tau}_k\)` using their shares of the sample, _i.e._,

$$
`\begin{align}
  \hat{\tau} = \sum_{k = 1}^K  \hat{\tau}_k \dfrac{N_{1k} + N_{0k}}{N}
\end{align}`
$$
